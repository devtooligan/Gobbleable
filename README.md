# Gobbleable

Art Gobblers vow not to engage in Cannibalism got you down?  Don't worry fren!  Now you can wrap a Gobbler in a distortion field which will allow it to be gobbled by another Gobbler.

During the process a Goo Discharge Portal is installed in the Gobbler, allowing an operator to interact with it even after it's been gobbled and is sitting in the belly of another Gobbler.  Available interactions include adjusting the goo balance of the goo tank, having the gobbled Gobbler gobble more NFT's, and staking and shooting goo into @cmichele's GooStew.
